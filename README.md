If the word ends in "y", print "-ies":</br>

If the word ends in "ey", print "-eys":</br>

If the word ends in "ife", print "-ives":</br>

```
In: Daisy
-ies

In: life
-ives

3. A triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene. All 3 sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same length, and a third side that is a different length. If all of the sides have different lengths then the triangle is scalene. 

Write a program that asks the user to "Input a number: " 3 times (can be decimal fractions).  The numbers are the 3 sides of a triangle. Display one of the four messages indicating which triangle it is.

"Scalene"

"Isosceles"

"Equilateral"

"No Triangle"

Note: If two sides of a triangle add up to less than the third side the triangle does not exist.
